**Treat a failing test as evidence to investigate, not permission to change the assertion.**
Reproduce the failure and compare the expected behavior with the relevant flow
plan, product requirements, and prior behavior. If it is a regression, fix the
production code rather than changing the test to match the regression. Change a
test only when the behavior change is intentional; explain the old expectation,
the new expectation, and the reason in the pull request. Apply the same scrutiny
to deleted, skipped, or weakened tests.
