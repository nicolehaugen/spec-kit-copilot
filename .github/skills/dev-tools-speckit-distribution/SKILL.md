# Spec Kit distribution

Repository-maintainer skill, not a shipping core CLI skill. Defaults to **prepare**;
never infer release authorization from a development edit or preparation request.
No automatic workflow mutation or second packaging pipeline.

## Prepare (no publishing side effects)

1. Record current worktree status; identify target repository/ref. Select
   `config\distribution.upstream.example.json`,
   `config\distribution.fork.example.json`, or an explicitly supplied custom
   JSON. Examples are choices, not inferred from the branch.
2. Run `node dev-tools\prepare-distribution.mjs --config "<JSON path>"`.
   Show its actual affected-file diff, locators, and printed install commands.
   Only with explicit approval repeat with `--apply --expect "<preview digest>"`.
   Preserve sibling dated backups. Re-preview conflicts; never force overwrite.
   The helper preserves IDs, versions, requirements, custom/unrelated metadata
   and catalog entries, deriving only Canvas Design and vertical-control links
   plus catalog self URLs and marketplace display metadata. It refuses
   manifest/catalog version conflicts; reconcile only through an authorized edit.
3. Review Git diff and validate the selected manifests/catalogs. Update related
   documentation manually if authorized. Print commands, do not execute them
   as part of prepare. Preparation does not make remote metadata available and
   does not change runtime settings, commit, push, tag, publish, or bump versions.

## Release (explicit authorization required)

1. Confirm repository, release commit/ref, components, versions, and publication
   authorization. Separate authorization for commit/push from publication.
   Update only selected component versions and matching manifest/catalog/docs.
   Follow existing marketplace metadata version rules only when releasing.
2. Prepare aligned metadata as above, run focused package/contract tests and
   target URL validation. Inspect existing extension and preset trigger/publisher
   workflows; reuse them unchanged except separately approved fixes.
   `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` controls publisher download URLs. Ensure prepared metadata
   matches the repository actually executing the workflows. Never relocate or
   release unrelated upstream catalog entries just to make fork checks pass.
3. Commit/push only when authorized. Publish from the prepared release commit/ref
   using existing **Release Extension Trigger** (`extension-canvas-design`,
   exact version) and **Release Preset Trigger** (`copilot-vertical-phase-control`,
   exact version), only for selected changed components. Review trigger inputs,
   use `gh workflow run ... --repo <owner/repo> --ref <release ref>`, then inspect
   workflow completion, tags and ZIP assets. Never move tags or replace a ZIP.
4. Publishing an asset does not update hosted catalogs. Do not expose catalogs
   pointing at missing assets: stage the prepared release commit/ref, publish
   selected assets, then promote the intended catalog/marketplace ref with
   authorization. Fetch served metadata and verify exact versioned assets before
   announcing availability. Do not alter workflows automatically.

## Verify-install (published path, no local overrides)

1. Confirm target marketplace/catalogs and clean test project. Use printed
   matching marketplace commands; install Wizard and required core skills.
   Reuse `speckit-cli-setup`, `speckit-extension`, and `speckit-preset` for
   Specify consumer operations; do not rewrite those skills as publishers.
   Catalogs need `--install-allowed` to permit installation; reconcile existing
   registrations explicitly rather than blindly adding duplicates.
2. Activate corresponding runtime settings explicitly with preview/confirmation
   and provider reload/restart. Use a single active installed provider pair;
   `dev-tools-speckit-wizard-installed-open` can explicitly enable Generate.
   Check actual installed provider versions/provenance and both persisted
   disabled entries. Do **not** use installed-refresh to verify a published path.
3. Use no local-source overrides. Retrieve the **published archives selected by
   the catalogs**, compare actual versions/content/contracts, and verify child
   Canvas Design and vertical-control installations, resolved contributions,
   Designer and generated output. Report unavailable/incompatible hosted packages
   as release-readiness concerns, never as local-source success.

Leave personal skills untouched; use `/skills reload` to discover this project skill.
