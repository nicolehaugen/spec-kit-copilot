# Copilot Vertical Phase Control

This Specify preset replaces the generated Canvas Design Workflow page's phase
adapter with a vertical, numbered step list and a Copilot Autopilot action.
The Wizard and Designer do not gain a new appearance setting: select this preset
alongside `extension-canvas-design` before Generate. The generated app packages
the selected adapter and its managed-run phase-control definition, and runs
without the design-time preset installed.

In local development, add it from this checkout using
`specify preset add --dev ./spec-kit-presets/copilot-vertical-phase-control`.
After its versioned release is published, register the repository's preset
catalog with `--install-allowed` and use
`specify preset add copilot-vertical-phase-control`.

Each step can be started manually. Autopilot asks the attached Copilot session
to run the installed skills in order; the host validates reported outputs
before accepting the next step. Stop or a failed/missing output leaves the
workflow pending for an explicit retry. Like the stock control, a manual retry
while a prior turn is pending may duplicate work; check chat first. Project
Constitution remains a separate, project-scoped action; the default generated app retains its
horizontal control when this preset is not selected.
After a generated app restart, an unfinished Autopilot run is persisted as
blocked. Check chat and outputs before retrying: the next request starts at
the first unverified step, never replays a verified step, and restores the
session mode from before the original run when it finishes. If every step
was already verified, there is no step to retry; check chat for the outcome.
An active Autopilot workflow cannot be deleted until it stops or finishes.
Its Stop action remains visible when a different workflow is selected; phase
progress on that workflow is not attributed to the active run. You can change
the selection to reach Stop, but must stop a blocked run before starting
Autopilot on another workflow if Copilot is still in Autopilot mode.
The managed-run capability is declared in the preset's phase-control JSON and
frozen into generated configuration. The server verifies both packaged hashes
without executing the browser module.

This preset depends on the Copilot Canvas Design runtime and its Copilot
session APIs. Its packaged adapter requires `workflow.rows.v1` and
`workflow.managed-run.v1` host capabilities; a generated host missing either
reports an incompatibility instead of silently omitting Autopilot. It is not
a general-purpose Specify layout preset. Its catalog archive URL only becomes
usable when the versioned preset release is published.
