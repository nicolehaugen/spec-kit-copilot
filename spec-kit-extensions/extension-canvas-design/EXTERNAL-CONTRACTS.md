# External customization contracts

`external-` identifies a contract consumed by preset/extension authors: definition
shapes, executable exports, arguments, callbacks, results, capabilities, and
lifecycle. It does not identify every file containing contributor data.

The filenames classify and isolate the existing interfaces; they do not change
contribution IDs, artifact kinds, template names, versions, validation, behavior,
or customization points. There are no old-path aliases. Contributor modules
remain self-contained and do not import these host-owned contracts.

## Locations and ownership

The following abbreviations keep the index readable:

- **D**: `plugins/spec-kit-copilot-wizard/extensions/speckit-canvas-designer/`.
- **R**: this package's `generated-scaffold/`.
- **S**: this package's `schemas/`.
- **DT**: `D/test/`.
- **RT**: `spec-kit-extensions/tests/`.
- **E2E**: `tests/e2e/`.

Designer contracts ship with the Copilot Wizard plugin, independently of this
Specify extension. Generated contracts are copied and syntax-checked through
`scripts/generate.mjs`'s `featureFiles` inventory. The finished app does not need
the original design package or presets.

Hosts retain rendering mount-point selection, navigation, persistence,
session/workflow operations, artifact access, action checks, execution,
confinement, integrity, and diagnostics. Adapters retain DOM rendering, events,
and interaction wiring, including composite controls. The contracts contain the
existing boundary checks; they do not dispatch actions or run contributed code.
Provider script construction describes execution, but execution stays in the
runtime's worker/VM.

## Definition and executable index

All schema names below are relative to **S**. Executable checks may intentionally
differ between inspection, generation, and live mounting. Do not substitute one
host's checks for another's.

The test-preset journeys are mapped to their fixture IDs and last observable
surface in [the E2E README](../../tests/e2e/README.md). Python package tests validate
the shipping file inventory, all definition schemas, and fixture registrations.

## Registration and inspection

Executable contributions are named Specify **templates**, not native script
registrations. Existing replace-only winner, source, ownership, reference,
collision, and slot rules apply. The composed `load-page` command explicitly
names contributed tabs and templates; discovery tags do not register them.

`external-executable-modules.mjs` checks the required export names below from
lexer results. The loader still parses source and syntax-checks it separately.
Executable modules retain their 32 KiB limit and self-contained requirement.
Inspection does not import browser adapters or execute providers to test them.
Badge input identity/version literals retain their separate static checks.
Runtime checks, including actual export values and mandatory handles, happen at
the same boundaries as before.

## Exports, calls, and lifecycle

### Designer controls and badge editors

Designer controls export `controlId`, `valueContract`, `mount`, and `validate`.
The declared value agrees with the definition; Node-side typed-control checks
and browser scalar/image/object checks retain their existing distinctions.
The host calls:

```js
mount({ root, field, value, onChange, ...imageContext })
```

Only images receive `context: { setBusy }`. `onChange(value)` retains structural
value checks, updates the draft, and triggers the existing Save/Generate state
updates. `mount` is synchronous here. Its handle must expose `isReady`;
readiness must return literal `true`, not a promise or another truthy value.
This does not impose generated-control lifecycle requirements on Designer
controls.

Badge editors export `controlId`, `contractVersion = 1`, and `mount`. The host
supplies `{ root, rule, inputs, phases, outputs, onChange }`. The badge editor
receives the existing cloned rule/input/evidence context. `onChange(nextInputs)`
requires exactly the rule's declared inputs, safe JSON data, and compatible
draft evidence. Old-render callbacks remain ignored. The captured `isReady`
method is called with the control as its receiver and must return literal
`true` before saving. Existing unavailable-control diagnostics, optional
`validationError`, optional `dispose`, and disposal/readiness failure handling
remain in the editor; no new method is required.

Badge controls with the `declare-markdown-output` capability must export the
literal `declaresMarkdownOutput = true` and return a handle with
`handlesOutputDeclaration = true`. Only those controls receive
`onDeclareFile(phase, path)` at mount; the host validates and records a new
expected Markdown output without changing the inferred View target.
Missing or incompatible declarations and handles fail before that action is
available. Controls without the capability never receive the callback.

### Workflow and phase adapters

Workflow adapters export `pageId = "workflow"`, `contractVersion = 1`, and
`mount`. They receive `{ root, definition, state, actions }`; their mount may
be asynchronous. Their handle must provide `update(state)` and `dispose()`.
State validation includes the existing `phaseState.slugEditable`,
`model.userProvidesSlug` agreement, and project badge result rules.

Workflow actions remain `selectWorkflow`, `createWorkflow`, `deleteWorkflow`,
`selectPhase`, `run`, `view`, `saveDraft`, `runConstitution`, `viewConstitution`,
`constitutionDraft`, `saveValue`, `setIdentity`, `setConstitutionDraft`,
`touchSlug`, `confirmSetup`, `clearSetupPlan`, `mountPhase`, `showDialog`, and
`error`. Their existing arguments, return values, and guards are implemented
by `R/ui/app.js`; this refactor adds no actions.

Phase adapters export `controlId = "workflow-phases"`, `contractVersion = 1`,
and `mount`. Optional `requiredCapabilities` accepts the existing unique
`workflow.rows.v1` and `workflow.managed-run.v1` capability names.
They receive `{ root, definition, state, actions }` and synchronously return
`update(state)` and `dispose()`. Actions remain `select`, `run`, `view`,
`runAt`, `viewAt`, `startManagedRun`, `stopManagedRun`, `confirmRun`, `reveal`,
`draft`, and `error`. Rendering uses the supplied states and host-owned actions;
adapters do not call workflow endpoints. Manual Run/retry remains reachable
while a prior agent turn is unanswered.

### Added pages and generated controls

Added-page renderers export `renderPage`. The host awaits
`renderPage({ root, canvas: { id, displayName }, values })`. No new renderer
version or disposal handle is required. The renderer emits declared
`data-field-slot` and `data-asset-slot` mount points; the host retains missing,
unknown, and duplicate slot diagnostics.

Generated controls export `controlId`, `valueContract`, and `mount`.
Legacy object presentation receives `{ root, field, value, values, readValues }`.
Placed controls additionally receive `editable`; `onChange` is supplied only
for editable values and saves through the existing host value action.
`update` and `dispose` remain optional on placed-control handles. The host
retains updates, navigation cleanup, stale async-mount disposal, and inline
errors. Stock text receives its existing slot/class context; stock image
receives the authorized packaged image URL and `{ alt, className }` context.
No new generated `validate` export is required.

### Badge evaluators

Evaluators export `contractVersion = 1` and `evaluate`. The generated worker
awaits `evaluate({ ruleId, inputs, evidence, workflowId })`.
`evidence` exposes the existing async `readArtifact({ phase, output })`,
`getRun(phase)`, and `countMarkdownFiles({ phase, output })` methods.
Undeclared artifact/directory evidence returns the existing unknown-state
diagnostic; an undeclared run returns `null`.

Results require boolean `match`; optional `values` is an object, optional
`summaryCount` is a safe integer from 0 through 1,000,000, and optional
`diagnostics` is an array of strings. The serialized result retains its 8192
character limit. Execution limits, hashing, caching, placement, and error
reporting remain in `badge-runtime.mjs`, not in evaluator modules.

### Values and computed providers

Providers retain a single direct `export function provideValue` or
`export const provideValue` declaration, not a named re-export. The generated
worker calls `provideValue({ workflow })` with the existing frozen selected
workflow containing `id`, `slug`, and `label`. Results must be synchronous and
JSON-serializable, within the existing 8192-character serialized limit and
declared string/boolean/object value schema.

Typed result validation retains its `UserError` behavior and existing
`structuredClone` return. It does not add arbitrary input/output sanitization.
Source/hash approval, module integrity, execution time limits, provider error
reporting, and worker/VM isolation remain unchanged. Providers are not run
during Designer inspection.

### Dialogs and buttons

Dialog adapters export `dialogId = "stock.dialog"`, `contractVersion = 1`,
and `mount`. The host awaits
`mount({ root, definition, context, onDecision })`. The handle requires
`dispose()` and a thenable `result` resolving to `"confirmed"` or `"cancelled"`.
The host supplies its existing no-op `onDecision`, awaits `result`, disposes
in `finally`, and clears the root. Phase dialogs receive the selected phase
context; concurrency reservation and workflow-change checks remain host-owned.

Button adapters export the registered `controlId`, `contractVersion = 1`,
and `mount`. The host awaits `{ root, definition, onSetup }` for setup or
`{ root, definition, onTrigger }` for a dialog trigger. Their handle requires
`dispose()`. Confirmation, cancellation, setup, and phase dispatch remain host
actions. Generation retains its existing direct-source export checks, which
are intentionally not replaced with live-import checks.

## Fixed-shell and nonvisual exceptions

Required Designer identity fields use the fixed identity control. Outputs
uses the existing fixed artifacts control and remains hidden in the current
Designer UI. Neither is a newly customizable adapter boundary.
Nonvisual settings such as custom-slug and show-setup use a Designer checkbox
without a generated visual adapter; the host consumes the frozen boolean.
Stock rendering can be reused rather than creating per-field/per-element
adapters. Computed providers and badge evaluators are nonvisual.
Generated-only pages and Designer-only tabs do not implicitly add a page to
the other host. Visual custom controls rendered in both hosts retain their
paired definition/adapter registrations.

## Internal contracts remain internal

`wizard-handoff.mjs`, `host-open.mjs`, `designer-settings.mjs`,
`generation-request.mjs`, `generated-output.mjs`, `workflow-state.mjs`,
`agent-actions.mjs`, and `packaged-contributions.mjs` remain unprefixed.
They govern host operations, transport, persistence, and integrity, not
interfaces contributor modules should import. `R/contract.mjs` remains the
internal generated configuration boundary; its typed result validator is
implemented in `external-value-provider.mjs`.

Missing validation or a known contract defect is not fixed by this naming and
extraction refactor. Such changes require explicit approval of old/new
semantics and compatibility impact. Local-source test success is not evidence
that the published archive selected by the hosted catalog contains these files.
